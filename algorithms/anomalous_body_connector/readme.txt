MATLAB Compiler

1. Prerequisites for Deployment 

. Verify the MATLAB Compiler Runtime (MCR) is installed and ensure you    
  have installed version 7.15.   

. If the MCR is not installed, run MCRInstaller, located in:

  <matlabroot>*/toolbox/compiler/deploy/glnxa64/MCRInstaller.bin

For more information on the MCR Installer, see the MATLAB Compiler 
documentation.    



2. Files to Deploy and Package

Files to package for Standalone 
================================
-anomalous_body_connector 
-run_anomalous_body_connector.sh (shell script run to temporarily set environment 
                                  variables and execute the application)
   -to run the shell script, type
   
       ./run_anomalous_body_connector.sh <mcr_directory> <argument_list>
       
    at Linux or Mac command prompt. <mcr_directory> is the directory 
    where version 7.15 of MCR is installed or the directory where 
    MATLAB is installed on the machine. <argument_list> is all the 
    arguments you want to pass to your application. For example, 

    If you have version 7.15 of MCR installed in 
    /mathworks/home/application/R2010a/v715, run the shell script as:
    
       ./run_anomalous_body_connector.sh /mathworks/home/application/R2010a/v715
       
    If you have MATLAB installed in /mathworks/devel/application/matlab, 
    run the shell script as:
    
       ./run_anomalous_body_connector.sh /mathworks/devel/application/matlab
-MCRInstaller.bin
   -include when building component by clicking "Add MCR" link 
    in deploytool

* NOTE: <matlabroot> is the directory where MATLAB is installed on the target machine.


4. Appendix 

A. On the target machine, add the MCR directory to the environment variable LD_LIBRARY_PATH.

        NOTE: <mcr_root> is the directory where MCR is installed
              on the target machine.         


        . Add the MCR directory to the environment variable by issuing 
          the following commands:

            setenv LD_LIBRARY_PATH
                <mcr_root>/v715/runtime/glnxa64:
                <mcr_root>/v715/sys/os/glnxa64:
                <mcr_root>/v715/sys/java/jre/glnxa64/jre/lib/amd64/native_threads:
                <mcr_root>/v715/sys/java/jre/glnxa64/jre/lib/amd64/server:
                <mcr_root>/v715/sys/java/jre/glnxa64/jre/lib/amd64 
            setenv XAPPLRESDIR <mcr_root>/v715/X11/app-defaults


        NOTE: To make these changes persistent after logout on Linux 
              or Mac machines, modify the .cshrc file to include this  
              setenv command.
        NOTE: The environment variable syntax utilizes forward 
              slashes (/), delimited by colons (:).  
        NOTE: When deploying standalone applications, it is possible 
              to run the shell script file run_anomalous_body_connector.sh 
              instead of setting environment variables. See 
              section 2 "Files to Deploy and Package".
