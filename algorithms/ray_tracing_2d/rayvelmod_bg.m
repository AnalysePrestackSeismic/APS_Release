% RAYVELMOD: establish a velocity model for vxz raytracing
%
% function rayvelmod(v,dg,z,x)
%
% Establish velocity model for raytracing
% v ... 2D matrix of velocities
% dg ... grid size for v. (i.e. both dx and dz are dg)
% z ... depth coordinate vector for v
% ******* default dg*(0:size(v,1)-1)' ***********
% x ... lateral coordinate vector for v
% ******* default dg*(0:size(v,2)-1) ***********

% This function stores the velocity model as a global. If
% you wish to save space, you can delete your model after
% calling RAYVELMOD.
