%% ------------------ FUNCTION DEFINITION ---------------------------------
% compile_function: function to compile a matlab function as C++ code.
% Requires the MATLAB Compiler Toolbox. Algorithms should be stored in a
% subdirectory of the algorithms folder with the same name as the function
% to be compiled.
%   Arguments:
%       algorithm_name = the algorithm to compile
%       subfolder = sub-directory where algorithms are stored
%       thread_type = 1 = Compile single thread
%                     2 = Compile multi threaded
%
%   Outputs:
%       none
%
%   Writes to Disk:
%       compiled function called algorithm_name and .sh file that sets up
%       MATLAB environment variables
% Notes: library_path needs to be set appropriately for your paths
